# Built-a-face-mask-detection-system-using-CNN-and-Python-to-identify-people-without-masks



A deep learning project to detect face masks in real-time using OpenCV, CNN, and Keras. Alerts via email when a person without a mask is detected.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/train.py`: Model training script
- `src/detect_image.py`: Detects mask in a static image
- `src/detect_video.py`: Detects mask in live video stream
- `src/detect_email.py`: Sends email alerts for no-mask detection

## 🛠 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
